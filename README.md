# Idea statement
Many companies and groups have parties which use Secret Santa as a way for colleagues and friends to bond.

# Technologies used
Rails, React JS, webpacker, Ruby, PostgreSQL.

# Wireframe
Wireframe can be found in the Wireframe folder.

# Installation instruction
Need to run db migrate (and db seed to seed users) to start.

# Unsolved problems/Challenges
Only learnt that I should have been passing more AJAX requests or that I could have made use of the pages made through Rails instead of passing information through html; I needed more time to implement that. Did not have time to implement a way to show to show whether a present has been bought.
